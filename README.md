# COVID-19
code for COVID-19 project

Guideline for using this code:
1. Generate csv. datafile according to the column names in R code.
2. Replace “…” with your own file pathway.
3. Codes for initial evaluation are independent, while codes for follow-ups need to run the initial evaluation codes first (for the bootstrap distributions). Also, change the “…” to read the csv. file which stores the distribution for each tasks.
4. OtherTasks include tasks didn’t need to regress out covariates.
